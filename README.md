This project consists of developing a smart thermostat that optimizes the heating and the cooling system of the house
the program consists of a broker that acts a server and handles all the input sent from the “Management APP”,
the “Smart Door Locker” and the “Connected Thermostat”. 
The goal of the project is to allow several users to enter their names and their prefered temperature into the Management APP so that, 
upon their entering into the house, the thermostat would adapt to their prefered temperature following certain assumptions.
